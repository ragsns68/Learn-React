<!-- why there are two files : react.development.js & react-dom.development.js ?
These files are the source code for react written by facebook developers.
react.development.js => Core file of React Library
react-dom.development.js => to bridge the gap b/w react and browser 
For Mobile React i.e. React Native, For React 3D we have other files.
You can check in the console, now the object named React and ReactDOM is being created.
