{TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX ?

The babel is used to convert JSX into React.createElement. Than the createElement gives an js object which gets converted into tag on render().
Is the translation required for react too ? I mean for createElement also ?
