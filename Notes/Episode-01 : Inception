Episode 1 : Inception (Talks on the core of React and the Environment) - The Beginning

Part 1: Basics & Hello World From HTML, JS, REACT =>

Commit 1:
Browser Used: Google Chrome
VS Code uses extension called as Emet.
we can generate plain html using => html:5 & press tab or ! & press tab  
the shortcuts are applicable only for the .html and .jsx files , can not work for .js file 
VS Code Editor is one of the best IDE Tool for frontend development

Commit 2:
the createElement,innerHTML, appendChild, etc. properties used in js are the superpowers which browsers undertands as they are already have in its JS Engine.  
But browser does not configured to understand the React, so we need some configuration for it.

Commit 3:
What is CDN ?
CDN is Content Delivery Network, a group of servers that caches the assets to the nearest proxy servers near to end users and serve quickly to required end. 

What is crossorigin?
crossorigin is an html script attribute which is used to receive assets from some other server/domain instead of origin. 
it sets the mode of request to HTTP CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), so as to allow resource from other domains.

why there are two files : react.development.js & react-dom.development.js ?
These files are the source code for react written by facebook developers.
react.development.js => Core file of React Library
react-dom.development.js => to bridge the gap b/w react and browser 
For Mobile React i.e. React Native, For React 3D we have other files but the react.development.js is the common file.

We can check in the console, now the object named React and ReactDOM is being created i.e. React for browser got configured sucessfully.

Significance of {} used in React.createElement and other methods of App.js file 
{} => In this we can provide any attribute to the element, here its h1
createElement gives the object with properties as props (id,xyz,children:Hello World From React)
render method is creating the tags 
most costly operation on the webpage is the updates in DOM tree , i.e. interacting with the UI , and all these libraries are trying to make it as much optimized as possible.


Git Commands =>
git init
git branch -M main (switch from master to main)
git add .
git commit -m 'episode-1'
git remote add origin git@github.com:ragsns68/Learn-React
git push origin main

Difference b/w git and github? 
git (Version Control System) manages the files of our project whereas github (A cloud service) manages the git repositories .
